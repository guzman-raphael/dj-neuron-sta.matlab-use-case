# Summary

Presents a DataJoint solution in MATLAB to a Spatio-Temporal Receptive Field (STRF) using Spike-Triggered Average (STA) from provided experimental data involving retinal ganglion cells.

Note: Incomplete at the moment. However, I was able to retrieve the same schema and data associated with it from the python exercise (running MATLAB at a lab in my university).


# Instructions

init()


# Points for Improvement

  * Update make methods for Imported and Computed tiers.


# Assumptions

  * TBD
